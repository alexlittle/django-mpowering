<h3>Anyone is welcome to share content resources on COVID-19 Library!</h3>

<p>
	If you believe your content meets <a href="{{ orb_guidelines }}">our

<h3>Are you interested in becoming an COVID-19 Library Content Partner?</h3>

<p>This is a more formal relationship with COVID-19 Library and COVID-19 Digital Classroom.</p>

<p>As a Content Partner, we will create an COVID-19 Library partner page with
	your logo, a short description of your organisation and a link back to
	your home page. We will also help connect with you other partners who
	may want to use your content or commission new content from you.

	Content Partners should have an internal quality assurance and review
	process in place, as this will help us fast-track your COVID-19 Library resources
	through our content review process.</p>

<p>The criteria for becoming a content partner are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Commitment to using open content licensing (Creative Commons)
		and sharing your digital health training materials on COVID-19 Library. <a
		href="https://youtu.be/zbqq6Gg5g3U">Watch our video on Creative
			Commons for Global Health</a>
	</li>
	<li>Robust, well-documented internal quality assurance and review
		processes - this helps us to fast-track your COVID-19 Library resources through our
		content review process</li>
	<li>Agreement to being an ambassador for COVID-19 Library - promoting its use
		by implementers, health workers and others</li>
</ul>

<p>
	To apply to become an COVID-19 Library Content Partner, please <a
		href="mailto:info@mpoweringhealth.org">contact us</a>. All Content
	Partners should send a letter of commitment, not to exceed one page,
	which documents how they meet these criteria and their motivation for
	becoming a Content Partner.
